<int> idineklara ng Armed Forces of the Philippines na wala ng banta ng terorismo sa Bohol at iba pang- -- tinaguriang tourist destination sa bansa .
[26.570]
sinabi ito ni A_F_P spokesperson brigadier general Restituto Padilla sa isinagawang press briefing sa Malaca√±ang matapos ang madugong engkuwentro ng militar at Abu Sayyaf group sa Bohol .
[37.040]
the armed forces is <hes> and the Philippine National Police is happy to inform you that the threats we face in the island of Bohol and the other unconfirmed report -- reports that have been coming our way as well as to the public regarding dangers post by terrorists in our tourist areas is already addressed .

[59.696]
the Bohol incident manifested a very deep seated plan on the part of terrorist to sow discord and to target high value individuals where they can earn a lot from .
[77.190]
dalawa pa sa tinutugis ng Abu Sayyaf group ay tukoy na ng militar .
[81.580]
we know where they are <hes> generally in what area and <hes> effort is still being done to pursue them .
[88.030]
but as I mentioned a while ago the assessment of the central command <hes> particularly the one <hes> given to me by general <hes> Oscar Lactao is that this two are fighting for their survival so they don't post any serious threat anymore .
[102.520]
hindi rin anya humihinto ang counterintelligence ng militar sa harap ng pagkakasangkot sa Abu Sayyaf ng police officer na si Maria Christina Nobleza .
[110.660]
pero sa kasalukuyan nananatiling matatag ang A_F_P sa usapin .
[114.780]
so the effort of counterintelligence in checking our ranks for any possible <hes> informants or those who can be working with the enemy never ceases never stops .
[125.104]
so it's done in a twenty four sev- -- twenty four seven basis it is continuing and it is <hes> focused on <hes> specific areas that commit possibly <hes> threatening to our security .
[136.675]
naglagay na ng deadline ang A_F_P na tapusin ang Abu Sayyaf kasama na ang Maute group hanggang July .
[142.570]
kinumpirma rin ni Padilla ang pagpapadala ng surrender feeler ni Isnilon Hapilon isa sa leader ng Abu Sayyaf .
[148.940]
'yan lang po ang ating self-imposed deadline para ho ma-adequately address at ma-degrade 'yong kapasidad ng mga grupong ito .
[156.720]
so <hes> we have also been pushing and <hes> claim and <hes> saying all along that the solution to all these problems is not purely military .
[165.240]
we are not the answer to all these problems .
[168.410]
what we are trying to push is a comprehensive approach that will go down to the roots of all these problem and address it adequately .
[176.630]
sa kasalukuyan ay may tatlundaan na lamang puwersa ang Abu Sayyaf mula sa dating limandaan at nananatili nilang kuta ang Jolo .
