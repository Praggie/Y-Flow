<sta> sa puntong ito balikan po muna natin ang tungkol s desisyon ng FIBA central <sta> board na China ang magiging host nation para sa twenty nineteen FIBA World Cup .
[13.790]
<sta> makakausap po natin mula sa Tokyo Japan si Chiqui Roa-Puno .
[18.001]
<sta> Chiqui anong masasabi mong pangunahing dahilan ng pagkatalo ng Pilipinas <sta> laban sa China para sa hosting rights ng FIBA ?
[25.310]
<no-speech>
[27.513]
<sta> well I thing ito sa case Lucie of <hes> 'yung ito talagang ipinagmalaki at ipinagyabang ng China na kanilang <hes> experience at saka 'yung kanilang know-how kung papaano nga mag-a -- magpalabas ng ganitong kasing kalalaking mga international events .
[42.520]
eh talagang tumatak na rin <sta> siguro sa FIBA at <hes> inulit ulit nila that they were promising more for this coming FIBA twenty nineteen <sta> at <hes> talagang they stressed the fact na hindi sila umaatras sa kanilang mga <hes> mga promises ano sa kanilang mga <sta> <hes> mga ipinapangako .
[59.591]
<sta> isa siguro 'yun at <hes> siguro madali din kasi sa ating madala sa ating pagiging <hes> <sta> madamdamin at emosyonal dahil nga nakikita natin ang ating mga kababayan .
[70.480]
pero kailangan nating alalahanin na ang kausap natin ay hindi lahat Pilipino at marami rin silang ibang mga bagay na <hes> kinokonsidera .
[77.899]
kasama ko rin dito <hes> <hes> Lucie si Quinito Henson na <hes> bahagi din ng delegasyon .
[83.719]
alam mo Quinito pinag-uusapan natin na tinatanong ni Lucie kung sa tingin mo ano ang naging <hes> parang pinaka- -- <hes> factor na -- na talagang nag <hes> nag <hes> desisyon or <hes> biniga -- <hes> pinag-isipan ng <hes> twenty six man panel at kung bakit unang-una napakatagal nila bago magbigay ng desisyon ?
[101.701]
well Chiqui <hes> Lucie ano sa tingin -- sa tingin ko hindi pa panahon natin .
[105.740]
<hes> ang ginawa natin sa ating presentation ay inangat natin 'yung level of playing field .
[110.800]
hindi natin <hes> tinapatan ang <hes> China sa in terms of resources and facilities kasi alam naman nating under dog tayo .
[117.790]
itong labanan David versus Goliath .
[120.279]
suntok sa buwan itong ginawa natin .
[122.089]
and we almost were there because <hes> sabi mo nga Chiqui nagkaroon sila ng two-timed delay bago nila in-announce 'yung decision because nahirapan sila .
[130.417]
the easier decision would have been to hand it to China right away .
[133.713]
but because napakaganda ng presentasyon ng Philippines napakaganda ng ating pagsasabi ng puso ang ating pagmamahal sa basketball .
[142.830]
eh napag-isip isipan din ng central board bago sila nagbigay ng decision .
[146.679]
but I think <hes> Chiqui no in the end it was hard and fast rules of resources .
[154.206]
uhm .
[154.448]
kung sino bang mas malaki kung sino mas maraming hotel rooms kung sinong mas maraming venues 'yung ang pinag-usapan ng central board at kaniya nabigay sa China .
[162.326]
tingin ko nahirapan din sila to take their emotions out of the equation kasi mismong sila mismo ng China ang nagsabi nga na nadala din sila sa ating presentasyon .
[170.879]
siguro nahirapan din ang <hes> ang FIBA panel to try to get that out of their heads and really think <hes> you know along the lines of <hes> pragmatism o practicality .
[178.781]
tawagan din natin si coach Chot Reyes who worked very hard siyempre kasama si coach Chot sa ating presentation .
[184.284]
Chot alam mo China <hes> also told you that they were impressed by our presentation but <hes> in the end it didn't go our way .
[194.360]
yeah it was Yao Ming himself who told me that <hes> our presentation was far better that their presentation .
[200.107]
seriously he said <sta> <hes> unfortunately you know it wasn't enough .
[204.949]
<sta> <hes> medyo ninerbyos ako 'nung makita ko 'yung <sta> final recap videos eh .
[209.301]
<sta> the -- the recap videos were <sta> infra versus infra .
[212.685]
<sta> infra of China versus our infra .
[214.642]
<sta> there was no puso <sta> in the final videos so ninerbyos ako do'n .
[218.207]
<sta> sabi ko mukhang infra to infra 'yung labanan .
[221.080]
<sta> so talo tayo .
[222.000]
<sta> pero sa tagal ng inantay natin sa ganda ng reception sa ganda ng <hes> reception even worldwide sa social media <sta> did you feel positive after our presentation ?
[232.030]
yes eh kumbaga nag-double overtime eh .
[234.124]
<sta> it went to double overtime and <hes> the central board members themselves came one by one to us .
[239.360]
<sta> and they really told how close it was and how a difficult decision it was for them .
[243.816]
<sta> sila mismo ang nagsabi lumapit sila dito sa 'min .
[246.530]
<sta> ah isa-isa so you know <hes> it just shows kung gaano kahirap itong desisyon na 'to and how -- how close we were kaya nakakahinayang .
[255.604]
pero still salamat sa lahat ng ating mga kababayan 'yung mga dasal n'yo 'yung mga tweet n'yo your messages .
[260.603]
'yung ating mga kapatid sa T_V five you know our digital five T_V five news five staffs sports five with all the work <sta> <hes> pinag-trend natin worldwide it was unbelievable .
[271.170]
sige Chot tawagin din natin si secretary Jimenez of the <hes> Department of Tourism who was also a part of this .
[276.245]
sir ?
[276.693]
<no-speech>
[277.700]
of course we did not get the result that we wantad no ?
[280.604]
yes .
[280.988]
what do you thing we should have done differently if anything at all sa ating presentation ?
[286.100]
well <hes> I cannot offhand thing of anything we would have done differently I think .
[291.090]
I think when you looked back at it the disappoint is really more that we probably should <hes> more strongly communicate not just here but in the near future .
[301.870]
our <hes> our strength in <hes> our ability to actually have the facilities the manpower and the planning skills <hes> to host this kind of event .
[312.862]
secretary we were up against the giant in China but yet we made it close no .
[317.560]
<hes> what were the factors that actually made it a close fight ?
[322.560]
<sta> well I think you -- you have to understand that <sta> basketball is at its very core very competitive therefore very emotional exercise .
[333.200]
very emotional human exercise .
[335.622]
and the Filipinos are <hes> as they say the most skilled basketball fans in the world .
[343.753]
they know their basketball .
[345.800]
and the reason why we got to this point is precisely because on the strength of that we had a story to tell .
[352.657]
the Filipinos cannot fall more in-love with the basketball than they <sta> already are .
[357.400]
ramdam na ramdam po 'yung talaga .
[359.163]
yes so the next step is really getting the rest of the world to fall in-love with it again .
[363.479]
opo marami salamat .
[364.463]
<overlap> and were kind of hoping that we would <hes> do that yes .
[367.010]
thank you very much for your time mister secretary .
[369.136]
we also want to talk to <hes> Quinito .
[371.217]
nandito si Lou Diamond Phillips was also part of our <hes> our presentation .
[375.924]
yeah how are you taking this ?
[377.709]
what are your thoughts at this time ?
[379.250]
first of all I am still incredibly -- incredibly proud of this delegation .
[384.820]
<hes> you know we -- we left our hearts on the court .
[387.969]
we <hes> fought a good fight did everything that we could .
[391.460]
and <hes> you know <hes> China is -- is obviously a <hes> very impressive and <hes> very you know <hes> very worthy opponent .
[402.009]
but <hes> I -- I feel like we have <hes> nothing to be ashamed of <hes> nothing to regret and <hes> we will steer the course keep fighting a good fight and hopefully one day bring it home to the Philippines .
[412.352]
well Lou when you're up there what was the reaction you felt <hes> from the people as you were speaking ?
[418.199]
I to be quite honest and you know I've been on stage before I've done this <hes> I thought they were with us .
[423.900]
I saw smiles .
[424.946]
I saw <hes> excitement .
[426.588]
<sta> I saw great <sta> interest and intrigue in what we were doing .
[430.334]
<sta> so I know that our message got through .
[432.892]
<no-speech>
[434.000]
<sta> I -- I could not even begin to -- to understand what difference you know <hes> considerations and <hes> <sta> what -- what the <hes> the international jury was looking for .
[445.689]
obviously we just got edged out .
[447.468]
<sta> what I will say is that the decision was to laid twice .
[452.279]
<sta> we had to wait for -- for you know the <hes> this decision from the jury .
[456.684]
<sta> so I know I know we made them think .
[459.393]
I know we made them talk and this was not an easy decision for them .
[463.247]
so <hes> I know that the Philippines put you know our best foot forward .
[467.209]
I also think we <hes> we made every Filipino once again proud of their heritage today .
[471.579]
thank you so much or your time .
[472.588]
thank you .
[473.535]
thank you .
[474.340]
kasama din natin ngayon si mister Sonny Barrios ang ating <hes> S_V_P <hes> president .
[480.560]
<sta> sir uhm .
[482.608]
ito nga grabe ang emosyon ngayon dito no nakita 'yung ups and the downs .
[486.253]
I think it is fair to say is it true correct to say na parang umaasa talaga tayo 'nung naghihintay tayo .
[492.104]
everybody had <hes> a feeling na we were going to get it .
[495.740]
well yes .
[497.094]
<hes> we were while waiting for the decision even ins -- inside the coffee break room everybody was saying we had a better presentation including some of our Chinese friends no .
[511.107]
and when the -- when our Q and A group came out and we talked about how it went <no-speech> sabi nila wala namang nangyaring ika nga <hes> hindi na atin nasagot ng maayos no .
[524.251]
so we were really hoping for the best but <hes> sabi nila sa basketball that's how the ball bounces ano and <hes> %incomplete
[532.225]
<sta> looking forward mister Barrios sport naman tayo .
[535.827]
looking forward mister Barrios no .
[537.320]
okay hindi na nga natin nakuha 'yung hosting rights for the twenty nineteen FIBA World Cup but mayroon tayong hinaharap na FIBA Asia Championships .
[546.243]
will this make us -- will this kind of decision <hes> very disappointing one will mate -- will this make us strive stronger to win that champions -- championship sa Changsa ?
[557.010]
well dapat lamang .
[558.544]
ang ano naman natin 'yung adversity ayokong sabihin na madali sa atin no but we always rise to the challenge Quinito .
[569.370]
and I think <hes> we are resilient enough and 'yung puso natin laban Pilipinas natin will prevail .
[577.700]
thank you .
[578.402]
<overlap> maraming-maraming salamat mister Sonny Barrios .
[579.899]
<overlap> thank you mister Barrios .
[580.212]
once again congratulations you -- congratulations to us .
[582.554]
alam mo Quinito <hes> just to summarize what happened here .
[585.760]
I think <hes> it wasn't all entirely a lost dahil nagkaroon naman ng parang renewed <hes> fervor sa ating pagiging proud na maging Pilipino .
[594.004]
nakita natin 'yan s pagka trending worldwide at sa iba-ibang tweets at messages sa -- on social media na talagang ramdam ng <hes> mga pinoy na kahit hindi man natin nakuha ang <hes> FIBA twenty nineteen eh marami tayong puwedeng ipagyabang at ipagmalaki .
[608.350]
well <hes> maganda 'yung sinabi ni Lou Diamond Phillips kani-kanina lamang no .
[611.679]
sinabi niya nothing to be ashamed of .
[613.340]
remember no 'nung nag-umpisa ang bidding process dito there were eight countries .
[617.950]
na-eliminate 'yung mga iba dalawa na lang natira Philippines and China .
[621.543]
we were up against giants right from the start .
[623.710]
na-eliminate natin 'yung Germany 'yung France 'yung Lithuania naiwan tayo at saka China .
[628.680]
<sta> then we gave China a good fight .
[631.010]
giant ang China Goliath ang China this time they do did prevail but David will still prevail later on I'm sure .
[637.398]
and I think we still did make an impression a napansin na naman tayo ng buong mundo and <hes> only for that reason hindi dapat tayo maging masyadong malungkot at <hes> alam ko ang ating <hes> chairman si Manny V Pangilinan is of course has mixed emotions din ngayon .
[651.769]
<hes> pipilitin nating makausap siya maya-maya dahil <hes> siguro nga medyo talagang <hes> iniisip pa niya kung ano ang nangyari as with everybody else .
[659.398]
'yan muna ang <hes> dito muna kami magtatapos <hes> Lucie at <hes> maya-maya kukunin din namin siguro ang <hes> panig ni Manny V Pangilinan at <hes> ibibigay din namin sa 'yo .
[669.587]
bask to you <overlap> oo Chiqui <hes> aabangan namin 'yang interview kay <hes> M_V_P siyempre dahil <hes> marami kaming mga tanong din dito dahil kami rin ay nagdurugo nga ang aming puso kaya gusto naming marinig straight from the horse's mouth ika nga what he thinks about the decision .
[685.536]
alright maraming salamat sa 'yo Chiqui Roa-Puno live mula sa Tokyo Japan .
